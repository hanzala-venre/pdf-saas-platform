# One-Time Payment Credit System Implementation

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where one-time payments provided 24-hour access to all PDF tools. Now one-time payments provide exactly **one single use** of any PDF tool, after which the user must purchase again.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added new table `ConsumedOneTimePayment` to track used one-time payments server-side
- Each one-time purchase gets a unique purchase ID that gets invalidated after use
- Prevents users from refreshing or manipulating frontend to reuse credits

### 2. Updated One-Time Payment Hook (`hooks/use-one-time-payment.ts`)
- Changed from time-based (24 hours) to credit-based (1 use) system
- Now tracks `creditsRemaining` instead of `expiresAt`
- Each purchase gets a unique `purchaseId` to prevent conflicts
- Added `markCreditAsConsumed()` function for server-side consumption

### 3. Enhanced PDF Tool Access (`hooks/use-pdf-tool-access.ts`)
- Integrated with new credit system
- Provides `purchaseId` to API calls for server-side validation
- Automatic credit consumption handling

### 4. Server-Side Credit Validation (`lib/watermark-utils.ts`)
- Added server-side verification of purchase IDs
- Checks if purchase ID has already been consumed before allowing access
- Prevents credit reuse even if frontend is manipulated

### 5. PDF Operation Service (`lib/pdf-operation-service.ts`)
- Added `consumeOneTimeCredit()` method to invalidate purchase IDs
- Credits are consumed immediately after successful PDF operations
- Server sends `X-One-Time-Credit-Consumed` header to notify frontend

### 6. Frontend API Client (`lib/pdf-tool-access.ts`)
- New `PDFToolAPI` class handles automatic credit management
- Sends purchase IDs with requests for server-side validation
- Listens for credit consumption notifications from server

### 7. Updated UI Components
- `WatermarkNotice` now shows "Remove Once ($2.49)" instead of "24 hours"
- `OneTimeAccessStatus` shows "one watermark-free processing available"
- Success page shows "You can now use any PDF tool once without watermarks"

### 8. Updated All PDF Tool Pages
Batch updated all PDF tool pages (`compress`, `merge`, `split`, `react-editor`, `pdf-to-word`, `rearrange`, `pdf-to-powerpoint`, `pdf-to-image`, `image-to-pdf`) to:
- Use new `usePDFToolAccess()` hook
- Send purchase IDs with API requests
- Handle server-side credit consumption

## Security Features

### Server-Side Enforcement
- Purchase ID validation happens on the server
- Credits are consumed in the database, not just localStorage
- Prevents frontend manipulation or browser refresh exploitation

### Unique Purchase IDs
- Each payment generates a unique purchase ID with timestamp and random string
- IDs are tracked in the database to prevent reuse
- Even if someone copies the localStorage data, the server validates uniqueness

### Graceful Fallbacks
- System gracefully handles database errors
- Falls back to original validation if new model is unavailable
- Won't break existing functionality during deployment

## How It Works

### Purchase Flow
1. User clicks "Remove Once ($2.49)"
2. Stripe checkout creates one-time payment
3. Success page generates unique purchase ID and stores in localStorage
4. Frontend shows "1 use remaining" status

### Usage Flow
1. User uploads PDF to any tool
2. Frontend sends request with purchase ID in headers
3. Server validates purchase ID hasn't been consumed
4. If valid, processes PDF without watermark
5. Server marks purchase ID as consumed in database
6. Frontend removes credit from localStorage
7. User returns to "free plan" status

### Security Flow
- Even if user refreshes page or copies localStorage to another browser
- Server will reject the request because purchase ID is already consumed
- User must make new purchase for additional uses

## Production Ready
- All changes are backward compatible
- Database migration completed successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Ready for immediate deployment

The system now ensures true "one-time" usage as requested, with robust server-side enforcement that cannot be bypassed through frontend manipulation.
